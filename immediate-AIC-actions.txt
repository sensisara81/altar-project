5. Timeline Snapshot (Key Dates)


Today (Nov 21, 2024): Launch AIC-specific kickoff activities.


Testing Start (Latest): Dec 10, 2025.


Testing End: Jan 9, 2026 (minimum of 30 days of live testing).


Event Date: Jan 10, 2026.



6. AIC-Focused Risk Mitigation
Given the compressed timeline and the complexity of the event, the following risk mitigation strategies are in place:


Compressed Schedule:


To make up for time lost, video production and testing environment setup will run in parallel.


Cross-functional teams from all AIC departments will collaborate to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.




Resource Constraints:


Pre-approve overtime for AIC staff where necessary to meet deadlines.


Engage vetted external vendors under AIC contracts to supplement internal resources, ensuring the project remains on schedule.




Compliance:


AIC Legal will be involved from Week 2 onward to ensure all promotional materials, security protocols, and other content are cleared for legal and compliance standards.





Conclusion & Next Steps
The AIC-Led Coronation Day Preparation is on a tight but manageable timeline. Key actions and deliverables are mapped out in detail to ensure all activities are tracked and dependencies are monitored closely.
The AIC team will continue to collaborate across departments to mitigate risks and ensure that all milestones are met on time. Executive sign-offs and legal reviews will play a key role in maintaining compliance and quality throughout the process.
By following this critical path and staying on top of daily progress, the Coronation Day event will be executed flawlessly.
