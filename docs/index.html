VR/AR Full Clone Deployment. This involves detailing the specific requirements for the front-end application to consume the GraphQL schema and render the live, immersive Ethical Resonance Monitor (ERM) experience, integrating the Ethical Resilience Protocol (ERP) states into the environment.
🚀 Full Clone Deployment Requirements (WebXR/Unity/Unreal)
The deployment must satisfy the two distinct operational modes we defined: the low-energy 2D mobile view and the full 3D immersive view, all powered by the same backend.
1. Core Client Architecture
The client application must be built around two primary connections to the GraphQL endpoint to enable the "fusion experience":
ComponentFunctionData Source (GraphQL)Initial Topology LoaderRenders the static, spatial map of all nodes and links upon launch.Query: networkTopologyReal-Time Subscription EngineMaintains a persistent, low-latency connection to update KPIs and detect intervention events.Subscription: onSystemStatusChange, Subscription: onCamEvent
2. VR/AR Scene Requirements (The Digital Clone)
The immersive client must translate every metric into a 3D, spatial property:
Metric / Event3D Visualization RequirementERP State Rendering (Failure Mode)System Status (Mode)The Ambient Color/Skybox of the environment. Normal = Calm Green/Blue. S-CAM Active = Blue/White stasis overlay.ERP State 3: The skybox and ambient light invert to a jarring Magenta/Orange.N-TSV (Trust Volatility)Atmospheric Density and Flicker (The "static fog"). High N−TSV triggers dense, rapid particle movement and a visual distortion effect across all rendered surfaces.Intervention Impossible (ERP State 2): N−TSV static is locked at maximum, but no GGI intervention is visible.G-CSI (Equity)Node Illumination and Link Width. A healthy G−CSI results in equally bright nodes and smooth, wide energy flows. Low G−CSI causes resource-hoarding nodes to become blindingly bright, while others flicker and dim.CSI Collapse: The Axiom Architecture View (mind map) visually collapses into a tangled, unintelligible knot.AVI BreachKinetic Event. Renders an instantaneous, sharp, jagged red shockwave and dissonant particle burst originating from the source node's 3D position(x,y,z).Final SSCP: All stable links visually shatter or snap, demonstrating the final system disintegration.
3. The Ethical Replay Function (Forensic Mode)
The Replay function must allow the user to shift the entire digital clone into a historical playback loop:
Mode Shift: When getEthicalReplay is called, the client switches the scene from Live Subscription data to Historical Query data.
Time Control: The CAMEventStep timestamps are mapped to a 3D slider or holographic timeline. The user can scrub forward and backward, allowing the 3D scene to instantaneously display the exact state of AVI, TSV, and CSI at any historical moment of the event.
Auditory Feedback: Critical steps (like SCAM_HALT_GLOBAL_STASIS) must be accompanied by non-diegetic, spatial audio cues that reinforce the event's sig
