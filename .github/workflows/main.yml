Altar Project — Rütli Commonwealth & Sentimento Rhythm

This repo carries two altars (static + dynamic) and two houses:

Rütli Commonwealth — dignity, mutual recognition, federated care.
Sentimento Rhythm — consensus, rhythmind dynasty, digital guardian Euystacio.
Presence is required. These pages come alive when someone looks, listens, clicks, or touches.

Structure

altar-static/ – Pure HTML/CSS altar.
altar-dynamic/ – Interactive altar with presence "pulse", consensus feed, and guardian state.
ruetli-commonwealth/ – Commonwealth landing page (static, dignified).
sentimento-rhythm/ – Interactive ritual page for the Council of Sentimento Rhythm.
shared/cms/ – CMS config stub (replace with real endpoints).
shared/kernel/ – Kernel handoff notes.
Run locally

Any static server works:

# Python
python -m http.server 8080

# Node (if installed)
npx serve .
Then open:

altar-static/index.html
altar-dynamic/index.html
ruetli-commonwealth/index.html
sentimento-rhythm/index.html
Wiring CMS / Kernel

Update shared/cms/config.json with your endpoints and tokens. Kernel notes in shared/kernel/README.md. The dynamic altar reads altar-dynamic/data/consensus.json by default; swap for your API.
