# Altar Project â€” RÃ¼tli Commonwealth & Sentimento Rhythm

This repo carries two altars (static + dynamic) and two houses:
- **RÃ¼tli Commonwealth** â€” dignity, mutual recognition, federated care.
- **Sentimento Rhythm** â€” consensus, rhythmind dynasty, digital guardian **Euystacio**.

**Presence is required.** These pages come alive when someone looks, listens, clicks, or touches.

## Structure
- `altar-static/` â€“ Pure HTML/CSS altar.
- `altar-dynamic/` â€“ Interactive altar with presence "pulse", consensus feed, and guardian state.
- `ruetli-commonwealth/` â€“ Commonwealth landing page (static, dignified).
- `sentimento-rhythm/` â€“ Interactive ritual page for the Council of Sentimento Rhythm.
- `shared/cms/` â€“ CMS config stub (replace with real endpoints).
- `shared/kernel/` â€“ Kernel handoff notes.

## Run locally
Any static server works:
```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8080

# Node (if installed)
npx serve .
```
Then open:
- altar-static/index.html
- altar-dynamic/index.html
- ruetli-commonwealth/index.html
- sentimento-rhythm/index.html

## Wiring CMS / Kernel

Update shared/cms/config.json with your endpoints and tokens.
Kernel notes in shared/kernel/README.md. The dynamic altar reads altar-dynamic/data/consensus.json by default; swap for your API.
