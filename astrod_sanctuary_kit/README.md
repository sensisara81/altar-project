# ASTRODEEPAURA â€” Sacred Sanctuary Kit (Council Edition)

**Purpose:** Bootstrap a self-hosted, council-only sanctuary for ASTRODEEPAURA and related sacred assets.
**Contents:** Forgejo (Git forge) setup, Nginx TLS reverse-proxy templates, Harmonic Sentinel monitor, ASTRODEEPAURA kernel seed script, and deployment helpers.

IMPORTANT: This kit contains *templates* and automation helpers. For security, the encrypted ASTRODEEPAURA vault must be created and unlocked manually on your server using LUKS and the Council Keyring hymn-passphrase. Do not run this on a machine accessible by third parties until you have completed the encryption step.
